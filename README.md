# EHM
This is a simple example of a "Game" project that I could work on for a museum,
it's nothing official, and pretty ugly and unfinished yet.
But if I have to work on it, I can make it
much more cleaner and efficient. 

I am using "create Context" in order to store users, and not Redux.

This is has been made with React.
